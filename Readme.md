# Netflix Data Visualization

## Introduction
This project analyses data on Netflix shows and movies to gain insights into the most watched genres and ratings distribution.

## Instructions:

### Data Preparation
1. Download data to the working directory and rename it to `Netflix_shows_movies`.

### Data Exploration
1. Explore the data and check for missing values.
2. Describe the data and perform statistical analysis.

### Data Cleaning
1. Address missing values by:
   + dropping selected columns having too many missing values and not required for the visualization
   + dropping rows with missing values.

2. Save the cleaned file as `Netflix_shows_movies_clean`

### Data Visualization
1. Create visualizations for the most watched genres and ratings distribution using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   
### R Integration
1. Switch Jupyter lab kernel to R and implement a ratings distribution chart in R using ggplot2.
   
## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have Python and R installed. Or run on Jupyter lab or Jupyter while switching kernel to R to run R code.
2. Run the Python scripts for data preparation, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
3. Run the R script for the ratings distribution chart.
